```cpp
/**
 * ActorComponent is the base class for components that define reusable behavior that can be added to a different types of Actors
 * ActorComponents that have a transform are known as 'SceneComponents' and those that can be rendered are 'PrimitiveComponents'
 */
// ActorComponent is base class to attach to the AActor:
// - support scene graph (hierarchy): USceneComponent
// - support rendering: UPrimitiveComponent
class UActorComponent : public UObject
```

* ActorComponent의 변수

```cpp
    /** describes how a component instance will be created */
    // EComponentCreationMethod is just four, I recommend to remember these four methods (not memorizing!)
    // see EComponentCreationMethod (goto 16) 
    EComponentCreationMethod CreationMethod;

    /** main tick function for the component */
    // as we covered FActorTickFunction in AActor, similar functionality is provided
    FActorComponentTickFunction PrimaryComponentTick;


    /** indicates if this ActorComponent is currently registered with a scene */
    uint8 bRegistered : 1;

    /** if the render state is currently created for this component */
    uint8 bRenderStateCreated : 1;

    /** does this component automatically register with its owner */
    uint8 bAutoRegister : 1;

    /** whether the component is activated at creation or must be explicitly activated */
    uint8 bAutoActivate : 1;

    /** whether the component is currently active */
    uint8 bIsActive : 1;

    /** if true, we call the virtual InitializeComponent */
    uint8 bWantsInitializeComponent : 1;

    // the below bit flag indicates the initialization sequence of UActorComponent

    /** indicates that OnCreatedComponent has been called, but OnDestroyedComponent has not yet */
    uint8 bHasBeenCreated : 1;

    /** indicates that InitializeComponent has been called, but UninitializeComponent has not yet */
    uint8 bHasBeenInitialized : 1;

    /** whether we've tried to register tick functions; reset when they are unregistered */
    uint8 bTickFunctionsRegistered : 1;

    /** cached pointer to owning actor */
    // UActorComponent should have its owner as AActor
    mutable AActor* OwnerPrivate;

    /**
     * activation system 
     */
    /** called when the component has been activated, with parameter indicating if it was from a reset */
    FActorComponentActivatedSignature OnComponentActivated;

    /**
     * pointer to the world that this component is currently registered with
     * this is only non-NULL when the component is registered 
     */

## Example? `USceneComponent`

```cpp
/**
 * a SceneComponent has a transform and supports attachment, but has no rendering or collision capabilities
 * useful as a 'dummy' component in hierarchy to offset others 
 */
// as we covered, USceneComponent supports scene-graph:
// - what is scene-graph for?
//   - supports hierarichy:
//     - representative example is 'transforms'
class USceneComponent : public UActorComponent
{
    /** get the SceneComponent we are attached to */
    USceneComponent* GetAttachParent() const
    {
        return AttachParent;
    }

    // 18 - Foundation - CreateWorld - USceneComponent's member variables
    // with AttachParent and AttachChildren, it supports tree-structure for scene-graph

    /** what we are currently attached to. if valid, RelativeLocation etc. are used relative to this object */
    UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_AttachParent)
    TObjectPtr<USceneComponent> AttachParent;

    /** list of child SceneComponents that are attached to us. */
    UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing = OnRep_AttachChildren, Transient)
    TArray<TObjectPtr<USceneComponent>> AttachChildren;
};
