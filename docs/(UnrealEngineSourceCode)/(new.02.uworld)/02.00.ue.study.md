## `CreateWorld`

```cpp
/** static function that creates a new UWorld and returns a pointer to it */
// note that this function is static function
// - when you look through parameters in a function, care about their types
// - when we use UWorld::CreateWorld(), we only pass two parameters, so rest of parameters is not necessary to care
static UWorld* CreateWorld(
    const EWorldType::Type InWorldType, 
    bool bInformEngineOfWorld, 
    FName WorldName = NAME_None, 
    UPackage* InWorldPackage = NULL, 
    bool bAddToRoot = true, 
    ERHIFeatureLevel::Type InFeatureLevel = ERHIFeatureLevel::Num, 
    const InitializationValues* InIVS = nullptr, 
    bool bInSkipInitWorld = false
)
{
    // UPackage will be covered in the future, dealing with AsyncLoading
    // - for now, just think of it as describing file format for UWorld
    // - one thing to remember is that each world has 1:1 mapping on separate package
    //   - it is natural that all data in world needs to be serialized as file
    //   - in unreal engine, saving file means 'package', UPackage
    // - another thing is that UObject has OuterPrivate:
    //   - OuterPrivate infers where object is resides in
    //   - normally OuterPrivate is set as UPackage: 
    //     - where object is resides in == what file object resides in
    // - I'd like to explain what I understand about UPackage, don't memorize it, just say 'ah' is enough!
    UPackage* WorldPackage = InWorldPackage;
    if (!WorldPackage)
    {
        // UWorld needs package as its OuterPrivate and need to be serialized
        WorldPackage = CreatePackage(nullptr);
    }

    if (InWorldType == EWorldType::PIE)
    {
        // like ObjectFlags in UObjectBase, UPackage's attribute can be set by flags in similar manner
        // - we are not going to read it in detail, later we could have chance to meet again
        WorldPackage->SetPackageFlags(PKG_PlayInEditor);
    }

    // mark the package as containing a world
    // what is 'Transient' in Unreal Engine?
    // - if you have property or asset which is not serialized, we mark it as 'Transient'
    // - Transient == (meta data to mark it as not-to-be-serialize)
    if (WorldPackage != GetTransientPackage())
    {
        WorldPackage->ThisContainsMap();
    }

    const FString WorldNameString = (WorldName != NAME_None) ? WorldName.ToString() : TEXT("Untitled");

    // see UWorld class (goto 4)

    // we set NewWorld's outer as WorldPackage:
    // - normally, when you look into outer object, it will finally end-up-with package(asset file containing this UObject)
    UWorld* NewWorld = NewObject<UWorld>(WorldPackage, *WorldNameString);

    // UObject::SetFlags -> set unreal object's attribute with flag by bit operator (AND(&), OR(|), SHIFT(>>, <<) etc...)
    // - refer to EObjectFlags and UObject::ObjectFlags
    NewWorld->SetFlags(RF_Transactional);
    NewWorld->WorldType = InWorldType;
    NewWorld->SetFeatureLevel(InFeatureLevel);

    NewWorld->InitializeNewWorld(
        InIVS ? *InIVS : UWorld::InitializationValues()
            // as we saw FWorldInitializationValues, the below member functions mark the flag to refer when we create new world
            .CreatePhysicsScene(InWorldType != EWorldType::Inactive)
            .ShouldSimulatePhysics(false)
            .EnableTraceCollision(true)
            .CreateNavigation(InWorldType == EWorldType::Editor)
            .CreateAISystem(InWorldType == EWorldType::Editor)
        , bInSkipInitWorld);

    // clear the dirty flags set during SpawnActor and UpdateLevelComponents
    WorldPackage->SetDirtyFlag(false);

    if (bAddToRoot)
    {
        // add to root set so it doesn't get GC'd
        NewWorld->AddToRoot();
    }

    // tell the engine we are adding a world (unless we are asked not to)
    if ((GEngine) && (bInformEngineOfWorld == true))
    {
        GEngine->WorldAdded(NewWorld);
    }

    return NewWorld;
}

## Tips) `FWorldInitializationValues`

```cpp
/** struct containing a collection of optional parameters for initialization of a world */
// think of this pattern as one struct encapsulating multiple parameters for the code readability
// - this struct contains all necessary options to create world
struct FWorldInitializationValues
{
    /** should the scenes (physics, rendering) be created */
    // whether we create worlds (render world, physics world, ...)
    uint32 bInitializeScenes:1;

    /** Should the physics scene be created. bInitializeScenes must be true for this to be considered. */
    uint32 bCreatePhysicsScene:1;

    /** Are collision trace calls valid within this world. */
    uint32 bEnableTraceCollision:1;

    //...
};
```

## Tips) `UWorld`

```cpp
/** 
 * the world is the top level object representing a map or a sandbox in which Actors and Components will exist and be rendered 
 * 
 * a world can be a single persistent level with an optional list of streaming levels that are loaded and unloaded via volumes and blueprint functions
 * or it can be a collection of levels organized with a World Composition (->haker: OLD COMMENT...)
 * 
 * in a standalone game, generally only a single World exists except during seamless area transition when both a destination and current world exists
 * in the editor many Worlds exist: 
 * - the level being edited
 * - each PIE instance
 * - each editor tool which has an interactive rendered viewport, and many more
 */
class UWorld final : public UObject, public FNetworkNotify
```

```cpp
/**
 * the base class of all UE objects. the type of an object is defined by its UClass
 * this provides support functions for creating and using objects, and virtual functions that should be overriden in child classes
 */
class UObject : public UObjectBaseUtility
```

```cpp
/** provides utility function for UObject, this class should not be used directly */
// later we'll cover UObjectBaseUtility's member functions below
class UObjectBaseUtility : public UObjectBase
{
    UObject* GetTypedOuter(UClass* Target) const
    {
        UObject* Result = NULL;
        for (UObject* NextOuter = GetOuter(); Result == NULL && NextOuter != NULL; NextOuter = NextOuter->GetOuter())
        {
            // we are not getting into IsA(), which is out-of-scope cuz it is related to Reflection System
            if (NextOuter->IsA(Target))
            {
                Result = NextOuter;

    template <typename T>
    T* GetTypedOuter() const
    {
        return (T*)GetTypedOuter(T::StaticClass());
    }

    /** determine whether this object is a template object */
    // - I have been look through the unreal engine source code for long time, but I still can't explain what is archetype object with specific example
    // - you just think of it as CDO, class default object
    //   - for CDO, what I understand is like **initialization list** as default UObject instance
    bool IsTemplate(EObjectFlags TemplateTypes = RF_ArchetypeObject|RF_ClassDefaultObject) const
    {
        // note that if one of outer is template, the object is template
        for (const UObjectBaseUtility* TestOuter = this; TestOuter; TestOuter = TestOuter->GetOuter())
        {
            if (TestOuter->HasAnyFlags(TemplateTypes))
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

```cpp
/** low level implementation of UObject, should not be used directly in game code */
// this class is the most base class for UObject
// - look through its member variables
class UObjectBase
{
    /**
     * Flags used to track and report various object states
     * this needs to be 8 byte aligned on 32-bit platforms to reduce memory waste 
     */
    // bit flags to define UObject's behavior or attribute as meta-data format
    EObjectFlags ObjectFlags;

    /** object this object resides in */
    // as we said previously, it is written as UPackage
    // - note that as times went by, the unreal supports lots of features to support reduce dependency on assets:
    //   - OFPA (One File Per Actor) is one of representative example
    //   - in the past, AActor resides in ULevel and its UPackage is just level asset file, which is straight-forward
    //   - but, after introducing OFPA, an indirection is added, no more each AActor is stored in ULevel file, it is stored in separate file Exteral path
    // - I'd like to say that overall pattern is maintained, but as engine evolves, it adds indirection and complexity to understand its actual behavior
    // - anyway for now, you just try to understand OuterPrivate will be set as UPackage normally, it is enought for now!
    UObject* OuterPrivate;
