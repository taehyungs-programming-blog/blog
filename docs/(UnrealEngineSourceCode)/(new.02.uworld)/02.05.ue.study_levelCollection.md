* FLevelCollection은 Unreal Engine에서 사용되는 데이터 구조로, 여러 개의 레벨을 그룹화하여 관리하는데 사용됩니다. 
* 이 클래스는 Unreal Engine의 월드 내에 존재하는 레벨들을 효과적으로 관리하고, 레벨 전환, 스트리밍, 로드, 언로드와 같은 작업을 용이하게 합니다.

```cpp
// UWorld의 변수 중 하나이다.
TArray<FLevelCollection> LevelCollections;
```

```cpp
/**
 * contains a group of levels of a particular ELevelCollectionType within a UWorld
 * and the context required to properly tick/update those levels; this object is move-only
 */
// FLevelCollection is collection based on ELevelCollectionType
struct FLevelCollection
{
    /** the type of this collection */
    ELevelCollectionType CollectionType;

    /**
     * the persistent level associated with this collection
     * the source collection and the duplicated collection will have their own instances 
     */
    // usually OwnerWorld's PersistentLevel
    TObjectPtr<class ULevel> PersistentLevel;

    /** all the levels in this collection */
    TSet<TObjectPtr<ULevel>> Levels;
};
```

```cpp
/** indicates the type of a level collection, used in FLevelCollection */
// don't sticking to its types, we are going to understand it simply like dynamic level vs. static level
enum class ELevelCollectionType : uint8
{
    /**
     * the dynamic levels that are used for normal gameplay and the source for any duplicated collections
     * will contain a world's persistent level and any streaming levels that contain dynamic or replicated gameplay actors
     */
    DynamicSourceLevels,

    /** gameplay relevant levels that have been duplicated from DynamicSourceLevels if requested by the game */
    DynamicDuplicatedLevels,

    /**
     * these levels are shared between the source levels and the duplicated levels, and should contain
     * only static geometry and other visuals that are not replicated or affected by gameplay
     * thsese will not be duplicated in order to save memory 
     */
    StaticLevels,
